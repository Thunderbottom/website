<h4 class="text-center"><i>"Technically a DevOps, practically an absurdist."</i></h4>

Hey there! I'm a systems and security enthusiast from Mumbai, India. I currently work at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com) as a DevOps and Security Engineer, where I mainly solve problems pertaining to container orchestration, pipeline optimizations, and maintaining and enhancing the security and monitoring infrastructures.

My pursuits intrinsically gravitate towards *nix, open-source, privacy, and system infrastructure. In my free time, I try to explore new tech, play video games, read, and occasionally [compose music](https://soundcloud.com/harmonicseventhnoiseprotocol). You may also see what I'm up to right [now](/now). To keep updated with my work, follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Thunderbottom) or subscribe to the blog through the [RSS feed](/rss.xml).
