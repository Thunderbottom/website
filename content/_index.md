Welcome to my digital sanctuary! I'm a systems architect and security enthusiast based in Bangalore, India. I currently work at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com) as a DevOps and Security Engineer. My days here are spent orchestrating systems, writing code, optimizing pipelines, and fortifying security defensesâ€”essentially, I'm the person to call when technical chaos needs taming.

My pursuits intrinsically gravitate towards *nix, open-source philosophies, privacy engineering, and elegant infrastructure design. In my free time, you might find me exploring new tech, diving into immersive game worlds, occasionally reading, and rarely [composing music](https://soundcloud.com/harmonicseventhnoiseprotocol). You may also see what I'm up to right [now](/now). To keep updated with my work, check out my [Forgejo](https://git.deku.moe) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Thunderbottom) or subscribe to the blog through the [RSS feed](/rss.xml).
