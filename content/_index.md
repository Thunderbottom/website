Hey there! I'm a systems and security enthusiast living in Bangalore, India. I currently work at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com) as a DevOps and Security Engineer, where I mainly solve problems pertaining to system orchestration, pipeline optimizations, and maintaining the security and monitoring infrastructure.

My pursuits intrinsically gravitate towards *nix, open-source, privacy, and system infrastructure. In my free time, I like to explore new tech, play video games, occasionally read, and rarely [compose music](https://soundcloud.com/harmonicseventhnoiseprotocol). You may also see what I'm up to right [now](/now). To keep updated with my work, check out my [Gitea](https://git.deku.moe) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Thunderbottom) or subscribe to the blog through the [RSS feed](/rss.xml).
